libshockwave
============

libshockwave is a work-in-progress C++ library for parsing SWF animations. Although originally meant for use with [PolyVector](https://github.com/BattyBovine/polyvector), it is designed as a standalone library that can be used in any project.

Currently, only features related to loading and displaying flat-coloured shapes is being implemented, as it's meant primarily for game animation.
